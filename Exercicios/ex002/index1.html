    <h1>I want to be when I grow up</h1>
    <p>I'm trying to change my life as a formal worker. <br>
        And for this change, i know for surre
        that i will need to put so much effort. And study a lot. <br>
        And i hope that this effort, someday, will be recompensated. <br>
    </p>
    <p>I think that in two yars i will be able to start in this new path <br>
       As a internship <br>
       After that, i hope to be a Junior of something like that. <br>
    </p>

    <p>Financially speaking, my expectation is to earn something about 5 and 10k <br>
       I need this to happand, because less than that, i will have to keep my atual area. As a saller <br>
